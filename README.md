# ABOUT ME
Hello, I'm a Front-end web developer. The coding language I know are HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.
I want to level up my skills by learning a new language so that I can handel Back-end as well.

This page would be my personal flutter study dairy and I will also upload projects that I have made step-by-step.
